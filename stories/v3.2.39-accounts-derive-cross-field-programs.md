# Story: v3.2.39 AccountsDerive Cross-Field Program Checks

> Enforce program field requirements for init and token/mint/associated token constraints.

## Goals

- Require `system_program` for init/init_if_needed.
- Require token/associated token program fields when constraints are present.
- Keep validation typed at comptime.
- Sync docs and roadmap.

## Acceptance Criteria

### anchor/src/dsl.zig

- [x] Init/init_if_needed requires system_program field.
- [x] Token/mint constraints require token_program field when not explicitly set.
- [x] Associated token constraints require associated_token_program field.

### Documentation

- [x] Update `anchor/README.md` with cross-field program requirements.

### Tests

- [x] `../solana-zig/zig build test --summary all` passes in `anchor/`.

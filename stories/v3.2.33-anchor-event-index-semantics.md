# Story: v3.2.33 Anchor Event Index Semantics

> Tighten indexed event validation with fixed-size integer rules and clearer errors.

## Goals

- Reject `usize/isize` and non-fixed-size ints for indexed event fields.
- Provide clearer compile-time errors for invalid index types and index overflow.
- Sync user-facing docs.

## Acceptance Criteria

### anchor/src/dsl.zig

- [x] Indexed event fields only accept bool, fixed-size ints (8/16/32/64/128/256), or PublicKey.
- [x] Invalid indexed field errors include field name and type.
- [x] Too many indexed fields errors include the indexed field list.

### Documentation

- [x] Update `anchor/README.md` event index rules.
- [x] Update `docs/ANCHOR_COMPATIBILITY.md` entry.

### Tests

- [x] `../solana-zig/zig build test --summary all` passes in `anchor/`.
